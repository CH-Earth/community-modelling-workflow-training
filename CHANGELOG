# Changelog

* March 30th, 2024:
 1. The `scipy-stack/2023b` and `ipykernel/2023b` module have been
    moved to the end of the `module load [....]` command, as it
    seemed to cause issues with the `sys.path` addresses in the
    Python environments. With the current order, everything seems
    to work as excpected.
